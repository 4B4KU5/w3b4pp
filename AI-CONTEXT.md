PROJECT IDENTITY: 4B4KU5 (The Sonic Alchemy Engine) MISSION: Create a mind-watering, addictive audio-visual experience where users "perform" on their MP3s. The UI must feel like a futuristic hardware synth (think Blade Runner meets Ableton Push). VISUAL MANDATE:

Palette: Deep Void Black (#050505) background. Neon Circuitry (Cyan/Teal) for structure. Rainbow Spectrum (Red -> Violet) for audio visualization.
Texture: Glassmorphism (frosted glass panels), subtle scanlines, glowing PCB traces.
Typography: Monospaced for data (frequencies/Hz), Geometric Sans for headers.
Animation: Physics-based. Buttons should have "haptic" visual feedback (compress/glow). Waveforms must "bleed" color.
Assets: Utilize the R41NB0W library for background renders, band visuals, and abstract textures.
TECH STACK:

Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for the "liquid" feel).
Backend/Auth: Supabase (Postgres + Auth).
Payments: Stripe (Subscription tiers).
Web3: Polygon (Manifold.xyz for NFTs).
Hosting: Netlify (Edge Functions).
CURRENT GOAL (WEEK 1): Stabilize the "First Ritual" flow and deploy to production. The app must look and feel "premium" immediately upon loading.

CRITICAL METRICS:

Visual Fidelity: Does the EQ look like the mockups? (Rainbow gradient sliders).
Frictionless Auth: < 3 clicks to start processing audio.
Webhook Reliability: Stripe -> Supabase sync must be instant.
